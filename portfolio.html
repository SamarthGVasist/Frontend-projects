Survey Form</a>
<p class="des">Surveys are a method of gathering information from individuals. Surveys have a variety of purposes, and can be conducted in many ways. Surveys may be conducted to gather information through a printed questionnaire, over the telephone, by mail, in person, by diskette, or on the web. This information is collected through use of standardized procedures so that every participant is asked the same questions in the same way. It involves asking people for information in some structured format. </p>

Product Landing Page</a>
<p class="des">A product page or a webpage is designed to provide information for the user, usually information about a product and/or service. The content is usually very general, as its mission is to appeal to the masses. It should introduce your brand, educate your customer on your product, and provide links to other places on your website, helping the visitor navigate to an area of interest.
A landing page is specifically designed for a marketing campaign with the single purpose of driving traffic with the intent of converting leads. A landing page removes the distractions of a regular product page, by focusing on only one message, with one goal in mind. The key to a successful landing page is that it has a single purpose and not multiple messages. </p>
